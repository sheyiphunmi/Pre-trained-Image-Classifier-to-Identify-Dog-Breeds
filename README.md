# Pre-trained-Image-Classifier-to-Identify-Dog-Breeds
Image Classification for a City Dog Show


This project was part of the requirements for [AI Programming with Python Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/ai-programming-python-nanodegree--nd089).

In this project, an image classifier was used to classify pet images as dogs, and identify the breed of the images classified as dogs using three convolutional neural network (CNN) structures. Three CNN model architectures were explored and compared to determine which is best.
