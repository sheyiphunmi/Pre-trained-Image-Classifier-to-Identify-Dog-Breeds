2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, the model architectures did not classify the breed of Dog_01.jpg to be the same as that of Dog_02. The three models classified the breed of Dog_02.jpg as "kelpie."


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer:
